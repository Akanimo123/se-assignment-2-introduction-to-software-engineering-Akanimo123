Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering can be defined as the process of applying engineering principles to software design and development. Software engineering is the process of solving customers' problems by systematically developing high-end software systems. It differs from traditional programming as it involves teamwork and proper coordination. Unlike software engineering, traditional programming does not apply engineering principles such as modularization and life-cycle plans.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
There are six phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). They are as follows: Analysis, Design, Coding, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance.
Analysis: This is the phase in which the requirements for the proposed software system are identified and detailed. It is in this stage that the user and system requirements are also identified and documented in a Requirements Specification document.
Design: The system and software designs are now produced at this stage from the requirements in the specification document. Here, software models of the intended solution are developed using various tools such as the Unified Modelling Language (UML) which allows the software developers to create a vsisualized format of the software. The design stage is also where the blueprint of the system is created before it is then converted to the programming codes and instructions. 
Coding: This stage invloves implementing the designed blueprint into codes that will now make up the software. This can also be done using various paradigms. Here, the software can be coded either with an object-oriented approach or through a structural approach that is a top-down design. In essence, at this stage, the programming specifications are converted into computer instructions.
Testing: This is a quality control practice that invlobes testing the now developed software for potential bugs and errors. At this stage, certain test runs such as unit, user acceptance and sytem testing are carried out on the test data of the software.
Deployment: At this stage, the software is installed on the users' systems. This is done after testing and by deploying a software product, the software is formally released into the appropriate market.
Maintenance: This is the stage in which updates are being made to the software system in order to better optimize it and eliminate errors.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
The agile model is an iterative software development model while the waterfall model is a sequential based softeare development model. Both models are used in developing software. Differences between the agile and waterfall models are as follows:
1. The agile model is a flexible model while the waterfall model is rigid in approach.
2. The agile model allows for high customer feedback but the waterfall model does not.
3. Working software is available early using the agile model but working software is delivered late using a waterfall model.
A scenario in which agile model should be preferred over waterfall model is a scenario in which the situation is time-critical and the project requires the customer to be heavily involved so as to allow for rapid delivery of the software within that time constraint. A scenario that favours waterfall model over the agile model is a scenario in which the situation is not time-critical but rather allows for adequate time and attention to be given to each phase. Waterfall model is also useful in situations in which heavy and proper documentation need to made and reviewed.
Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirement engineering can be defined as the process of investigating, analyzing and documenting software system requirements. The process of requirements engineering is as follows:
1. A feasibility study on the proposed software solution is carried out which determines if the development of the software is achievable or not. The requirements document is produced at this stage.
2. Secondly, the requirements for this new system are then elicited which can also call for the involvement of the stakeholders. The requirements can be gathered either by conducting interviews with the stakeholders, observing the existing system fisrthand or carrying out surveys etc.
3. Then, the collected requirements are now furher specified to produce the requirement specifictaion documents that defines both the user and system requirements.
4. Lastly, the requirements are then validated which ensures that the outlined requirements are consistent with the customers' demands.
Requirement engineering is important in the SDLC because without this process, then the software developers will run the risk of developing a system which does not solve the customers' problems as the correct requirements were not well captured and dcoumented. Requirements engineering is essential for the success of the feasiblity study and analysis stage.
Software Design Principles:
ExplaModularity in software design means the dividing of a large system into smaller and simpler independent parts called modules. With this, the entire system as a whole is easier to understand because each part can be focused on its own without interference from the other parts. As modularity creates separate modules, the impact of changes is reduced as maintenance is done on other areas rather than on the whole system. This way, there is less risk of compromising the system if a bug or error occurs. Modularity also improves scalability, as by breaking up a system into chunks of modules, more resources can be added, integrated and worked upon independently without compromising the software architecture.
in the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
1. Unit testing: The practice of testing the individual programs and components that make up the software system.
2. Integration testing: The practice of testing the entire system for defects after integrating the individual system components that make up the resultant system.
3. System testing: The practice of testing the entire system.
4. Acceptance testing: This is the final testing stage that verifies if a system meets its functional and non-functional requirements.
Testing is crucial in software development as it ensures all requirements were implemented correctly. Testing also helps identify and remove defects and bugs before the software deployment into the market.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems are tools that help people manage changes to their codes over a period of time. They are important in software development because without these software tools, developers will be unable to keep track of their progress as version control systems simplify maintainability which is a crucial phase of software development. Examples of popular version control systems with their features include:
1. Git- It is fast and scalable. It has a good command line interface and it can be used for high-level operations.
2. Subversion (SVN)- It is a centralized version control tool that improves stability and interoperability (LogRocket).
Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
The role of a software project manager is to plan, direct, motivate and coordinate a group of professionals and available resources to accomplish the development of a quality software product. The key responsibilities of a project manager include organizing, staffing, directing, representing the organization and budgeting etc. Challenges that might arise can be pressure of meeting the customers' deadlines, maintaining up-to-date communication with the stakeholders and other team members etc.

Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying and updating software. The different types of maintenace activities are corrective, adaptive, preventative and perfective. Corrective maintenance means correcting faults and errors in a software product. Adaptive maintenance is updating a software product in order to meet changing technological demands or policies. Preventative maintenance means identifying and removing present faults in a system so that they do not become more harmful in the future. Perfective maintenance is the process of adding new features to a system and removng irrelevant ones so that a software product can continue to stay on the maket and meet users' demands(Thales). Maintenance is an essential part of the software development life cycle because it ensures that a software product remains relevant in the market after deployment(Thales).

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Ethical issues that software engineers might face might be invasion of customer privacy and also conducting biased testing practices. Some software engineers can fall victim to copyright infringements and piracy. Software engineers can adhere to the ethical standards of their work by acting in the best interests of their clients and the general public. Engineers should also be fair and supportive to their colleagues and abstain from indulging in unethical practices.
